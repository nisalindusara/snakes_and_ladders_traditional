Snakes and Ladders 🐍

The traditional board game snakes and ladders created with C for four players. The simulation game will run without any user interaction. This means once the executable file is run the game simulates the behaviour of the players and produces the results.

The project consists of three files header.h containing macros and shared data structures and functions, logic.c where all the gloabal variables are declared and the functions are implemented and the main.c file containing the game loop and high-level flow. This seperation of concerns allows easier debugging, scalability, faster recompilation and easier collaboration.
